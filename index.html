      <h1 class="afterimg">Welcome to Kitchener-Waterloo Youth Orchestra!</h1>
      <p>KWYO is a community based non-for-profit organization committed to supplementing music education by bringing to Waterloo region's youth, ages 5 to 22, a continuity of a high standard orchestral instruction and rewarding performance opportunities in a fun, challenging and safe environment.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to bring together in a creative process of ensemble performance the  music-loving students to empower them to grow and to develop numerous transferable skills needed to thrive as an individual and a team member. KWYO's leading ideas of inclusivity, equality, versatility and accessibility provides paths for nurturing thriving and compassionate community members, arts enthusiasts, as well as professional and community musicians.</p>
      <p>KWYO activities for four orchestras in progressive levels run from September through April, in two Waterloo locations. Please see the details below. Students are accepted via audition. Our live spring auditions have concluded. KWYO still accepts new students through video-auditions and will offer a limited in-person opportunity in early September. We are actively searching for students playing viola, double bass, bassoon, trumpet, French horn and trombone. To register for an audition, for audition requirements and info on video-auditions, and with any other questions contact us at <a href="mailto:kw.community.yo@gmail.com">kw.community.yo@gmail.com</a></p>
