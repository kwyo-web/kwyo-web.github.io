KWYO's leading ideas of inclusivity, equality, versatility and accessibility provides paths for nurturing thriving and compassionate community members, arts enthusiasts, as well as professional and community musicians.</p>
      <p>KWYO activities for four orchestras in progressive levels run from September through April, in two Waterloo locations. Program details including rehearsals and concerts schedules and cost TBC soon. Students are accepted via audition.
